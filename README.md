# **UI Soft Shadow**

This is an example of light/dark shadows applied to buttons to test this trend in design ðŸŽ¨

**Conclusions:**
Taking into account that this kind of design is very goog looking for most people, it is not very helpful for people with eye disabilities to help them recognize UI controls, In case you choose this style for your app I would recommend having bold borders on the controls for better readability
